 Map created by Supercaden231, and helped by jcjcwolf819

``` 
Citadel is a map that features medievaled styled houses, and a graveyard.
This map is one our larger maps, taking a plot and a half. A plot is usually 100 blocks, but this is 150 blocks.
The map has a unqiue style of medieval. There's a few eastereggs, and it is different from any other
medievaled style maps. The map was really easy to be built, and it took only a weekend to finish.
This map is more detailed than any other map that is currently on the server.
