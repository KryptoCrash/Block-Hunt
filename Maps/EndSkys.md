# End Skys
 Map created by KryptoCrash and Wither_Man99 

``` 
End Skys is a map that consists of 2 gamemodes. 
The first gamemode is the orginal Hunter Vs
Hider gamemode while the 2nd is a new three mode
gamemode made by KryptoCrash where the three teams
are hider, hunter, and Inspector. The inspector
team can show hiders and hunters and can help 
either team. This team however is invisible but can
not fly. This means that both teams will hear what
inspector team says in chat. End Skys is end based on a 
sky island map.
