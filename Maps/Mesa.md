# Mesa
### Map created by Skillsbo

``` 
Mesa, this map is centered around the same biome, this map has water structures, and
abandoned mineshafts, this one of our smaller maps, since it is only made by one person. The map has not a lot of variety.
This is a easier map to play on due to the caves that have tnt in it. This is a map that has taken longer than most do.
